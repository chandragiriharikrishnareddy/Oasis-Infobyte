        <p>Ada Lovelace, born in 1815, is celebrated as the first computer programmer. She envisioned the potential of computers far beyond simple number crunching. Her notes on the Analytical Engine include what is essentially the first algorithm intended to be processed by a machine, making her a visionary of her time.</p>

        <h2>Contributions to Computing</h2>
        <p>Lovelace's work laid the foundation for the modern computer. She was the first to express the potential for computers to go beyond mere calculation or number-crunching, envisioning the computer age long before it became a reality.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Developed the first algorithm intended to be carried out by a machine.</li>
            <li>Envisioned applications for computers that wouldn't be realized for over a century.</li>
        </ul>
